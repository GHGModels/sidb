          #  - soil/climate zones: Subxerous, Xerous, Ultraxerous
          #      - subxerous zone (Lower Taylor Valley): coastal areas and low elevation areas (<100m), weak soil horizon, shallow profiles with ice-cemented layers within 30cm of the surface
          #      - xerous zone: low to mid elevation areas in the inland dry valleys and higher elevation areas near the coast, dry permafrost layers at 30â€“75cm, more developed soil horizons
          #      - ultraxerous zone (Beacon Valley): adjacent to the Polar Plateau or at high elevations (>1000m), very low soil moisture content, high concentrations of soluble salts

incubationInfo:
    desc: "CO2 accumulation in the headspace of the vessel was measured using a Li-Cor 6200. CO2 concentrations were blank corrected and expressed as soil respiration (mg C g soil^{-1} day^{-1})."
