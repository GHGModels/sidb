siteInfo:
       - studySite: McMurdo Dry Valleys of Southern Victoria Land, Antarctica
       - ecosystemType: Polar
       - climate: Cold
       - soilType: Gelisols
           - soil/climate zones: Subxerous, Xerous, Ultraxerous
               - subxerous zone (Lower Taylor Valley): coastal areas and low elevation areas (<100m), weak soil horizon, shallow profiles with ice-cemented layers within 30cm of the surface
               - xerous zone: low to mid elevation areas in the inland dry valleys and higher elevation areas near the coast, dry permafrost layers at 30â€“75cm, more developed soil horizons
               - ultraxerous zone (Beacon Valley): adjacent to the Polar Plateau or at high elevations (>1000m), very low soil moisture content, high concentrations of soluble salts
           - texture:
                  percentSand: >95

incubationInfo:
       - "CO2 accumulation in the headspace of the vessel was measured using a Li-Cor 6200.
         CO2 concentrations were blank corrected and expressed as soil respiration (mg C g soil^{-1} day^{-1})."
