siteInfo:
    studySite: "CoweetaLong-Term Ecological Research (LTER), Harvard Forest LTER"
    ecosystemType: Forest
    climate: temperate
    soilType: Coarse (CH)- to fine (CL) -loamy Haplumbrepts, Fine-loamy Dystrochrept (HMC)
              - organic-rich (CH, HOC, HOH)
              - organic-poor (CL, HMC, HMH)
          #      - xerous zone: low to mid elevation areas in the inland dry valleys and higher elevation areas near the coast, dry permafrost layers at 30â€“75cm, more developed soil horizons
          #      - ultraxerous zone (Beacon Valley): adjacent to the Polar Plateau or at high elevations (>1000m), very low soil moisture content, high concentrations of soluble salts
          #  - texture:
          #         percentSand: >95
    location:
      - Coweeta Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) site at high (CH) and low (CL) elevation
      - Harvard Forest LTER site in control (HOC, HMC) and heated plots (HOH, HMH), from organic-rich (HOC, HOH) and organic-poor (HMC, HMH) horizons

incubationInfo:
    desc: #"CO2 accumulation in the headspace of the vessel was measured using a Li-Cor 6200. CO2 concentrations were blank corrected and expressed as soil respiration (mg C g soil^{-1} day^{-1})."
