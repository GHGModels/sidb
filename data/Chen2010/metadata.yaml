incubationInfo:
    desc: "Fresh soil samples of 4 replicates, equivalent to 15 g dry weight each, were incubated in 125 mL jars under changing temperature.
           CO2 concentration in gas samples was measured using a gas chro- matograph (Agilent 6890, Agilent Corp., USA) equipped with a FID detector."
    treatments:
        - temperature: Temperature was continuously increased from the lowest to the highest with both intervals of 2 (0-30 degrees) and 7 (0-35 degrees) degrees.
