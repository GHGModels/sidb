					<p> 
                                         It contains time series of multiple studies across the world. Currently, there are {{site.data.summary.entries}} entries in the database. Most entries have multiple time series of CO<sub>2</sub> release from incubation experiments. The current total number of times series is {{site.data.summary.timeseries}}, and the total number of datapoints is {{site.data.summary.datapoints}}.
